# mRNA-seq

This repository includes the code I used in my Master's thesis for mRNA-seq analysis of TKI treated K562 cells. Raw reads in fastq format were processed using the bash script above and the resulting files can be used in a genome browser, or for differential gene expression analysis with DESeq2, for which the R script can be used. In addition, MA plots are provided as well as GSEA based on the MSigDB.
